Endb is a SQL document database with full history. The goal is to commoditize data tooling that developers can only get by cobbling together disparate tools or by building bespoke software: audits, GDPR compliance, versioned documents, time travel, dynamic schema and queries, analytics, operations, and horizontal scale without sharding.
