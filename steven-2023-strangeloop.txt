* All the good database ideas were used up in the 1980s
* 1985: The Golden Age of Databases
* The database scene peaked in 1984

Technical Bullets:

* unlimited disk
* vector dbs
* relational and document models

Cultural Bullets:

* SQL
* immutable data + FP
* strong, dynamic types

Description:

The goals of database research have extended far beyond technical
feasibility for decades.
In the 1970s and 1980s, disk and memory were major constraints on
database design.
The utility of the DSM (columnar data) was unclear.
Relational, document, and graph storage models hadn't proven themselves yet.

In the 2020s, we have unlimited cloud storage, productionized vector
databases, and a clear appreciation of each storage model.
In addition to loosening our technical constraints, software culture
has evolved.
A functional and dynamic query language for immutable data is possible
today, where it may not have had an audience even 10 years ago.

In this talk, we'll retrospect on the database dreams of the 70s, 80s,
and 90s.
We'll look at databases applying these decades-old ideas -- and what
problems they solve.
