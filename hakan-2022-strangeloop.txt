In an distributed setting with a large amount of append-only immutable
data, the strategies needed to effectively index data change. Recent
research in database indexing is exploring so called "learned
indexes", which uses machine learning to build predictive models of
the data, and also adaptive indexes - where the indexes start out as
small lightweight metadata that helps navigate the raw data, and
become more fine-grained as the data is queried. In this talk we'll
discuss the engineering constraints we run up against in this setting,
and how to solve them in ways that leverage the append-only and
immutable nature of the underlying data.
